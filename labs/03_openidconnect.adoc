= OpenID Connect (OIDC)

link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect] is a simple identity layer on top of the `OAuth 2.0` protocol/framework. With OIDC Clients are able to verify the identity of a _End-User_ based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server. Additionally an authentication server may provide information about the basic profile of a _End-User_ in a REST-like manner. OIDC makes heavy use of the Json Web Token (JWT) set of standards to digitally sign and encrypt that data in a compact and web-friendly way.

Today OpenID Connect belongs to the two popular industry standards for federated authentication (and so Single Sign-on) - the other standard is SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).

[NOTE]
====
OpenID Connect consists of a list of separate specifications which are listed on their website https://openid.net/connect/. In this chapter we focus on the core specification which defines the authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0.
====

== Abstract protocol

OpenID Connect is an extension for OAuth 2.0 and implements authentication. Clients may use this extension by requesting the `openid` scope value in the Authorization Request. Information about the authentication performed is returned in a _JSON Web Token (JWT)_ called an _ID Token_. OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect are also referred to as _OpenID Providers (OPs)_. OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect are also referred to as _Relying Parties (RPs)_.

. The _Relying Party (RP)_ -- requiring End-User Authentication and Claims from an OpenID Provider -- sends a request to the _OpenID Provider (OP)_
. The OP authenticates the End-User and obtains authorization.
. The OP responds with an _ID Token_ and usually an _Access Token_.
. The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo Endpoint.
. The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.

== Flow

The OpenID Connect process flow is the same as the OAuth 2.0 authorization process flow with the following additions:

* In addition to the `access token`, an `ID token` is returned by the authorization server.
* _Userinfo_ endpoint for getting more user information (if the `ID token` is not sufficient)
* `openid` is passed as a parameter in the Scope during the initial call to the Authorization server.

So if an Authorization server is also set up for OpenID Connect, you can in addition to exchanging the authorization code for an `access token`, also get an `ID token`, which can be used for user “authentication”.

The id-token is the added piece in OpenID Connect, that allows the OAuth 2.0 flow to be used for Federated Authentication.

== Use cases

The link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#openid-connect-2[Keycloak documentation] describes the basic use-cases as follows:

[cite, Keycloak documentation]
____
There are really two types of use cases when using OIDC. The first is an application that asks the Keycloak server to authenticate a user for them. After a successful login, the application will receive an identity token and an access token. The identity token contains information about the user such as username, email, and other profile information. The access token is digitally signed by the realm and contains access information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application.

The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access to remote services. In this case, the client asks Keycloak to obtain an access token it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of the user. Keycloak authenticates the user then asks the user for consent to grant access to the client requesting it. The client then receives the access token. This access token is digitally signed by the realm. The client can make REST invocations on remote services using this access token. The REST service extracts the access token, verifies the signature of the token, then decides based on access information within the token whether or not to process the request.

== Lab

Maybe you noticed that we already got in touch with OpenID Connect in the labs for OAuth 2.0? The endpoints of Keycloak already contained a hint in the URL like `/auth/realms/techlab/protocol/openid-connect/token`.

As you've read, OpenID Connect is an extension to OAuth 2.0. Keycloak implements OpenID Connect and that's why the endpoints are already suitable for OpenID Connect.

Take a look at the following figure which shows the communication for a OpenID Connect use-case:

[caption="OpenID Connect",link=https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/iam/openid_connect.html]
image::https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/assets/images/OIDC_sequence_diagram.png[]

So, to enable OIDC instead of pure OAuth 2.0 we basically just have to add the `SCOPE=openid` parameter to our initial authentication request.

OpenID Connect defines the following additional scope values that are used to request Claims:

* `profile` -- OPTIONAL. This scope value requests access to the End-User's default profile Claims, which are: name, family_name, given_name, middle_name, nickname, preferred_username, profile, picture, website, gender, birthdate, zoneinfo, locale, and updated_at.
* `email` -- OPTIONAL. This scope value requests access to the email and email_verified Claims.
* `address` -- OPTIONAL. This scope value requests access to the address Claim.
* `phone` -- OPTIONAL. This scope value requests access to the phone_number and phone_number_verified Claims.

A request could by e.g. contain the following scope parameter: `scope=openid profile email phone`

[TIP]
====
Keycloak does support some more scopes, like by e.g. roles or mircoprofile support. They are documented link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#protocol[here]. Some of them are enabled by default.
====

We have already done OpenID Connect requests in the lab for link:./02b_oauth2-implicit-code-flow.adoc[OAuth 2.0 implicit flow]. Try to get an ID token for the example we know from the link:./02d_oauth2-resource-owner-credentials-flow.adoc[OAuth 2.0 resource owner password credentials] lab:

[code,sh]
----
curl -s -X POST http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/techlab/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=techlab-cli&username=nerd&password=quirky&grant_type=password" | jq
----

Maybe you have to review the OAuth 2.0 spec for link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3.2[access token requests] for this flow.

////
curl -v -X POST http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/techlab/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=techlab-cli&username=nerd&password=quirky&grant_type=password&scope=openid" | jq
////

This request returns an access and an id token. Compare them with the help of link:https://jwt.io[JWT.io]. Are you aware of the differences?

The response may also return the `email` and `profile` scopes. They appear because the Keycloak client has enabled them as default scopes. What happens if you request a scope that does not exist? Try it with the email of user `nerd`.

////
Keycloak does not include claims for non existing data. Just add or delete a email for the user `nerd` and you will get it within your ID token or not.
////

As already mentioned in a previous lab Keycloak offers (as specified link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[here]) an `.well-known` endpoint at http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/techlab/.well-known/openid-configuration.

OpenID Connect specifies a link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[_Userinfo_ endpoint] to get claims about the authenticated End-User using a token. Try to implement a cURL request to the right endpoint using one of the tokens form the previous tasks.

////
export access_token=$(\
curl -s -X POST http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/techlab/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=techlab-cli&username=nerd&password=quirky&grant_type=password&scope=openid" | jq --raw-output '.access_token')

echo $access_token

curl -s -X GET http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/techlab/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token | jq
